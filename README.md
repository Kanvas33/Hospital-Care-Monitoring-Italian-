# Hospital Care Monitoring Dashboard using Microsoft Power BI(Italian)

## Project Overview

This GitHub repository contains the code and resources for a **Microsoft Power BI interactive dashboard** focused on **hospital care monitoring** within the context of **healthcare**. The project aims to **analyze** various aspects of hospital care, including **patient volumes, appointment statistics, doctor appointments, medical entries, and more**. By leveraging the power of **data analysis and visualization**, the project seeks to provide valuable **insights** for **hospital management and healthcare professionals**.

## Project Objectives

- **Analyze and monitor hospital care** data to gain **insights** into patient volumes, appointment trends, and medical entries.
- Provide a **user-friendly and interactive Power BI dashboard** for hospital **administrators** and **healthcare professionals** to make **data-driven decisions**.
- **Identify areas of improvement** in hospital care, such as **reducing readmission rates** and **optimizing patient stays**.

## Project Workflow

- **Data Preparation (ETL)**: The project involves **data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) using Power Query** to clean and structure the data for import into Power BI. This step ensures that the data is suitable for analysis.

- **Dashboard Design**: Careful consideration was given to the selection of data visualizations and chart types to **maximize the efficiency of data presentation**. The dashboard includes various sections covering **patient statistics, appointment data, doctor insights, and more**.

- **Patient Statistics**: This section includes the **total number of patients, patients per hour, and patients per month**.

- **Appointment Insights**: The dashboard provides insights into average appointment times (in minutes), the number of doctors, and doctor appointments.
   - **Doctor Performance**: Top-performing doctors based on the number of appointments are highlighted.
   - **Patient Demographics**: Data is presented on the number of patients in various age groups.
   - **Medical Entries Analysis**: Medical entries are categorized into sectors, including hospital wards and emergency care, with low, median, and high classifications. The analysis covers a one-year period in 2021.

- **Date Filter**: Users can use a **date filter** to select specific days in **2021** for detailed analysis.

## Achievements and Insights

- Identification of **patterns and trends** in patient volumes and appointment data.
- Insights into doctor performance and the **distribution of patient demographics**.
- Categorization and analysis of **medical entries by sectors** and **urgency levels**.
- The ability to quickly **spot areas that require improvement**, such as **high readmission rates** and **prolonged patient stays**.

## Conclusion

In **conclusion**, this Hospital Care Monitoring dashboard using Microsoft Power BI serves as a **powerful tool for hospital management and healthcare professionals**. By visualizing and analyzing various aspects of hospital care, the project aims to support better **decision-making**, resource allocation, and **overall hospital management**. The interactive nature of the dashboard allows for real-time monitoring and quick identification of areas for improvement, ultimately **leading to enhanced patient outcomes and satisfaction**.
