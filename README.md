- **Analyze and monitor hospital care** data to gain **insights** into patient volumes, appointment trends, and medical entries.
- Provide a **user-friendly and interactive Power BI dashboard** for hospital **administrators** and **healthcare professionals** to make **data-driven decisions**.
- **Identify areas of improvement** in hospital care, such as **reducing readmission rates** and **optimizing patient stays**.

## Project Workflow

- **Data Preparation (ETL)**: The project involves **data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) using Power Query** to clean and structure the data for import into Power BI. This step ensures that the data is suitable for analysis.

- **Dashboard Design**: Careful consideration was given to the selection of data visualizations and chart types to **maximize the efficiency of data presentation**. The dashboard includes various sections covering **patient statistics, appointment data, doctor insights, and more**.

- **Patient Statistics**: This section includes the **total number of patients, patients per hour, and patients per month**.

- **Appointment Insights**: The dashboard provides insights into average appointment times (in minutes), the number of doctors, and doctor appointments.
   - **Doctor Performance**: Top-performing doctors based on the number of appointments are highlighted.
   - **Patient Demographics**: Data is presented on the number of patients in various age groups.
   - **Medical Entries Analysis**: Medical entries are categorized into sectors, including hospital wards and emergency care, with low, median, and high classifications. **The analysis covers a one-year period in 2021**.

- **Date Filter**: Users can use a **date filter** to select specific days in **2021** for detailed analysis.

## Achievements and Insights

- Identification of **patterns and trends** in patient volumes and appointment data.
- Insights into doctor performance and the **distribution of patient demographics**.
- Categorization and analysis of **medical entries by sectors** and **urgency levels**.
- The ability to quickly **spot areas that require improvement**, such as **high readmission rates** and **prolonged patient stays**.

## Conclusion
